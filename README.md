## Project Description *(Software Lead)*
Our project idea is to create a game in which the player will manage a farm, while managing a business that will sell what they grow. There will be a set number of plots in which the player can place plants. The plant will then grow over time. Meanwhile, the player will receive customers that will receive plants in exchange for their currency. The player will then receive the customer's currency by clicking on a fully grown plant and then clicking on the customer. The goal of the player is to gain as much currency as possible.

## Program Design *(Backend Specialist)*
* Non-Standard libraries
    * pygame
       https://www.pygame.org/news
       Allows fo the use of video game related functions

    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![final diagram](assets/final_diagram.PNG)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes

    Cursormode - The cursormode class changes the state that the cursor is in. This allows different events to occur based on the state of the mouse when certain places are clicked. Each method controls a different cursor stateS. The different cursor modes that the player can be in are "NONE", "SEED", "WATER", "PLANT1", "PLANT2,", and "PLANTFULL".
 
    Plant - The plant class draws plot and plant objects to the gameplay screen. When the player opens the gameplay screen, this class creates 4 plots for the player to interact with. When the player is in the seed cursor mode and click on a plot, this will place down a plant. The plants created by this class will go through 3 different phases. The first and second phase share the same appearance, but the third phase can have one of 4 appearances.

    Customer - The customer class creates customers that will walk into your plant store. Each customer will ask the player for the plant. When the player clicks on a fully grown plant and clicks the customer, the customer will take the plant and the player's score will increase. Each customer will have an image file, x and y position in the your store, dialouge generator, values for a timer, formula for how much they pay.

    NewButton - The NewButton class creates button objects that only have text in them. Class takes color, x value, y value, width value, height, and the button text as the parameters. NewButton contains two methods. The first method "draw", draws a button on to the screen with the option to add an outline to the button. The second method "isOver", checks if the mouse is hovering over a button object.

## Tasks and Responsibilities *(Software Lead)*

### Software Lead - Nicholas Reyes

Conducted research on class functionality, wrote the docstrings for each method in each class, simplified code where needed, and made sure the gameplay screen was fully functional, interactive, and ran in real time

### Front End Specialist - Luca DiGrigoli

Conducted significant research on controller functionality, provided self-made images for backgrounds and icons, built the controller class, and cursormode class

### Back End Specialist - Adam Acevedo

Created button, customer, garden, and plant classes, established much of the framework of our project's concept, helped to give our project's ideas direction

## Testing *(Software Lead)*
* Whenever we attempted to implement a new feature we tested it through the GUI by making sure they were reacting to any user actions. We also will attempt to make sure the classes can interact with each other by making reactions from clicking from one class to another
    * Ex. Making sure that the buttons work by loading the start screen and going into the gameplay screen. Afterwards, clicking the plants and making sure that they can be applied to the garden plots
* In terms of script based testing, we often made methods that would print what is occurring with our code in order to ensure everything was functioning the way we want it to
    * Ex. Making sure buttons were working by printing when we successfully selected and deselected a button
